# Cricket Dashboard

## Overview
This repository contains a cricket analytics project where I scraped player data from ESPN and created interactive dashboards using Power BI. The dashboards analyze key player performance metrics, focusing on player roles such as Power Hitters, Anchors, Finishers, All Rounders, and Specialist Fast Bowlers, for the 2024 World Cup.

### Dashboards
Below are the key dashboards in the project:

1. **Player Analysis (Power Hitters/ Openers)**: 
   - Visualizes key metrics such as runs scored, strike rate, average, boundary percentage, and batting position.
   - Includes a comparative analysis of top openers like Jos Buttler, Kusal Mendis, and Alex Hales.
   - Shows batting trends with graphs illustrating averages, strike rates, and boundary percentages.

   - Provides a detailed breakdown of individual player performance, including balls faced, strike rate, boundary percentage, and average.
   - Example: Jos Buttler's performance across the tournament, highlighting his batting average and strike rate.

   - Key players such as Alex Hales, Jos Buttler, Rilee Rossouw, and more are analyzed for final selection.
